  documentation</a>.

Following day after I published the article I got this email from Flutter's Product Manager:


> Hi Marcelo,
>
> We love your article on layout -- several of us have been talking about it this morning. It's polished, comprehensive, and very well taught.
>
> Perhaps a little cheeky, but we wondered whether you'd be willing to consider adding it to the official product documentation (i.e. docs.flutter.dev)? We'd love to see the millions of Flutter developers who visit the docs each year have access to your tutorial.
>
> We'd be happy to attribute it to you; we just want to see great Flutter documentation reach the maximum possible audience. And several of us on the team have commented that we've learned new things about Flutter layout by reading it, so that's about as ringing an endorsement as it gets.
>
> Let me know if there's any interest. This isn't something we do often, but your work stands out!
>
> Warm wishes,
          
I was honored to have it published there, of course!

### _Flutter's native layout widgets can do a lot, but they can't do everything._

When they don't solve your problem, a good place to start looking for alternatives is these two layout packages I've authored:

* <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/align_positioned">align_positioned</a> — Lets you declaratively
  position/size widgets in complex ways.

* <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/assorted_layout_widgets">assorted_layout_widgets</a>
  — Includes widgets like `RowSuper` which will resize cells proportionately when content doesn't
  fit (native `Row` can't do that).
